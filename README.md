# Data Science Innovations in Financial Market Predictions
This project implements three different models to predict five different stocks from yahoo finance like Apple, Google, Amazon, Sony and Netflix. This projects predicts closing stock prices using historical data and technical indicators. The model are trained on adjusted closing prices and various technical indicators to predict future stock movements.

Following machine learning models are used in this project:
1. LSTM
2. GRU
3. Transformers.

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the adjacent closing prices of stocks for Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Sony (SONY), and Google (GOOGL). It uses three different models—Transformers, LSTM, and GRU—allowing users to compare their performance. The models are trained on historical data from 2012 to 2022, utilizing technical indicators like RSI and EMA to improve predictions.
